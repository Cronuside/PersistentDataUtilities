# PersistentDataUtilities
A simple class that provides you with all methods necessary for easily editing persistent data of players/items.

Feel free to use, would appreciate if you included some credits if you ever do so. I hope you guys like this and it helps with workflow when coding.

PERSISTENT DATA UTILITIES

WHAT IS IT?

Hi everyone, I've recently created a simple to use Persistent Data API.
With this API you can easily do the following:

- Edit Persistent Data Containers.
- Store Persistent Data Containers.
- Set values within Persistent Data Containers.
- Add values to Persistent Data Types to data that is stored within the Persistent Data Containers.

As of right now you can use each of these features when working with:

- ItemStacks
- Players

NOTE

I'll be potentially adding more to this in future, if you have any suggestions then feel free to let me know!
